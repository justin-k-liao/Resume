{\large\bf PROJECTS }\\

{\sl fMRI Motion Correction Project}

\hangindent=2.5em {\qquad Currently working on a project utilizing Matlab, and SPM12 to validate the results of Liao et al.( Effect of Brain Extraction of Low Resolution Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) fMRI Images on Realignment and Coregistration, Justin Liao, Jan Petr, Roland M Lazar, Randolph S Marshall, Iris Asllani, IEEE EMBS 2017)}\\

{\sl Multidisciplinary Senior Design: Interactive Rock Climbing Wall }

\hangindent=2.5em {\qquad Our goal was to design an interactive rock climbing wall for the use of adolescents on the autism spectrum. The plan was to design a network of wireless climbing holds that communicate with the climber and the instructor. I was responsible for working with mechanical engineers and electrical engineers on all aspects of the project, managing the team documentation website, as well as climbing hold design and manufacturing.}\\


{\sl 1D Thermal Imaging Camera Project}

\hangindent=2.5em{ \qquad Developing a proof of concept 1 dimensional 360 degree infrared thermal camera.	Utilizing a PICAXE – 08M2+ microprocessor programmed in BASIC to read data temperature data  And drive servo motor.}
